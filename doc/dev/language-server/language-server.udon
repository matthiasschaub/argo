# Basics

- `%language-server` works by loading an open `hoon` file into the app state and
  parsing it into an AST.
- When given a cursor position it attempts to mark the corresponding position in
  the AST.
- When a request for type information comes in it will traverse the AST until it
  reaches a marked location (the `%magic-spoon` or `%magic-fork`) and extract
  the type information.
- Requests are sent and received via the `hoon-language-server` binary.

# Known Issues

- Fails to resolve type information when inside the following rune forms:
  - TODO 
- Poor performance on large hoon files - `/sys` source files are disabled for
  this reason. Also problems with parsing heavily recursive hoon like
  `complete.hoon`. Enabling lsp on that file will consistently bail meme a ship.
- Problems parsing certain `%tsgr` expressions. Seems to stem from the `change`
  and `replace` arms in `complete.hoon`.
